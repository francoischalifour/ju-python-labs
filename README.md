# Python labs

> List of Python 3 laboratories written for the module *Programming in Python* at *[Jönköping University](https://ju.se/)*.

*This course was given by [Peter Larsson-Green](https://github.com/PeppeL-G).*

## Course description

In this course, you'll learn how to tell your computer what to do by using Python as communication tool. Although this is a programming course in Python, the focus will primarily be on programming. To practise programming we need to have a programming language, and in this course we happen to use Python, but after completing this course you will hopefully be able to learn other programming languages quite easily because you already know how to program.
