Create a program with a graphical user interface to play the game *Five in a Row* (which you completed in [lab 4.2](../lab4) and reworked in [lab 6.2](../lab6)). You decide if you want to use your work from lab 4.2 or from lab 6.2.

The game should be drawn on the screen, and the player should be able to place a cross or a circle by clicking on the cell he wants to place it.
